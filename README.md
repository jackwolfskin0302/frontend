## Running the project locally

### üìï Storybook instructions

The Storybook for Storybook contains every UI component. The UI is built following [Component-Driven Development](https://blog.hichroma.com/component-driven-development-ce1109d56c8e), a process that builds UIs from the ‚Äúbottom up‚Äù starting with components and ending with screens. That means contributors should compose UIs in Storybook _before_ integration with the Gatsby app.

1. yarn install
2. yarn run storybook

### Gatsby instructions

Gatsby is used for basic routing and static site generation.

1. yarn start
